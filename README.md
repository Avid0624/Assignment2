# Assignment2
: This is a simple assignment to walk through the steps of modifying a simple “Hello World” program and submit it through GitHub. The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate proper use of header files, to use github, to explain proper coding processes, and to demonstrate command line parameters.

This is my first C++ program in Data Structures class.
